# dayPlanner

### description

This is project began as refactored code that now allows a user to create a daily schedule.

I wanted to create a timetable with the ability to save the user's information.

Additionally, I created a color coding system to update the itinerary line's color based on past, present, and future events.



### usage

The planner displays the current day above hourly timeblocks.

Users can enter text beside the desired timeblock and use save button to return to plans later.

The scheduler automatically color codes past, present, and future events with green, yellow, and red, respectively.
